You can use any equivalent parts available in your country/region.

ESP32-C3 SuperMini (Wi-Fi/BLE) â€” small, cheap, works great with ESPHome

Home Assistant (any host) â€” tested with HA Green, but a Pi/mini-PC works too
Example: https://www.wifistore.ro/cumpara/home-assistant-green-84102

(Optional) ZigBee USB dongle (Sonoff ZBDongle-E) â€” not required for this project; Wi-Fi via ESPHome is used
Example: https://www.vonmag.ro/produse/info/zbdongle-e-6920075777659-pret-gateway-zigbee-30-usb-dongle-plus-e-sonoff

Water meters with reed switch (dry contact) â€” any brand/model is fine
Examples (RO):
Hot: https://www.emag.ro/contor-de-apa-zenner-etwd-apa-calda-1-2-kxg0190904/pd/D7560TMBM/

Cold: https://www.emag.ro/contor-de-apa-zenner-etkd-apa-rece-1-2-kxg0190903/pd/DD560TMBM/

Compatibility: any meter that exposes a reed contact will work.
If your meter produces 1 pulse = 10 L (or another scale), just change the on_press increment in ESPHome and the mÂ³ conversion in the package.
